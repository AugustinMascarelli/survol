# This takes a RDF document as input (As an URL) and creates a SVG
# document.
# It uses JenaTools and Jena.

# Alternatively, we can also merge several RDFs into a single
# one, but this is another task, which is worth doing because
# it could be faster than in Perl.
# If we receive several RDF as input, we might simply 
# transform them separately.

# Also: We have seen that a javascript library can display dot files.
# How can we simply merge things?
# Another type of output will be: Instead of sending a SVG document,
# it will send a HTML document, with the DOT data embedded into it,
# plus the calls to javascript webgraphviz.
# This is another reason to make things more modular:
# (1) Merge of several RDF documents, possibly with inference.
# (2) RDF to dot with graphic parameters.
# (3) DOT to SVG, server-side or client-side.
