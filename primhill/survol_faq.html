</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><br></span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; font-family: DejaVu Sans;">&nbsp;</span><br><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><br>ARCHITECTURE
<br><br></span><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">Survol needs to
run one agent
per machine: A plain HTTP server running Python scripts. This agent and
its port number define the identity of each object of this machine,
that Survol is able to provide informaiton about. This is exactly the
same concept as in WMI and WBEM, and both interoperate completely.
Therefore, Survol is able to get information with another machine
with no Survol agent: See OpenLMI, WMI etc... <br><br>If your browser runs ActiveX, it is also possible to use Survol web pages with no agent.<br><br>Survol
is based on a tree of Python scripts, all of them display information
of the system the agent is running on. Some scripts do not need
parameters: They will return information with no context: For example
all available databases, all detected machines on the network, all
installed Python modules etc... Other scripts need parameters, as they
display information about a specific object. For example; Files opened
by a specific process. Columns of a SQL Server</span><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">&#8482;</span><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"> table. Processes connected to an Oracle&#8482; database.</span><br>
<span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"></span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; font-family: DejaVu Sans;">SO
IT WORKS LIKE A HTTP SERVER. CAN I REUSE APACHE&#8482; OR IIS&#8482; ?</span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<br><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">For classical desktop or server applications, Survol can
use </span><a style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;" href="https://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"> and </span><a style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;" href="https://www.iis.net/">IIS</a><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"> (Internet Information Services).</span> <span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">As a set of Python scripts, it is compatible with CGI and WSGI.</span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">Survol comes with
its own HTTP server, a lightweight Python script, so it can run&nbsp;on very small machines and
is very appropriate for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things">Internet Of Things</a> applications. This also has the benefit to run on any user account, which gives access to much more information.</span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; font-family: DejaVu Sans;">DISPLAY
MODES AND INTERNAL DATA REPRESENTATION</span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<br><img style="float: right; width: 140px; height: 153px;" alt="Resource Description Framework" title="Resource Description Framework" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Rdf_logo.svg/221px-Rdf_logo.svg.png"><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">The
internal data model built by Survol, is based on</span><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework">RDF</a>,
a standard model for data interchange in the Web. The&nbsp; data
representation of Survol is a RDF graph: </span><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">a set
of triples: Subject, relation, object, and is also the core data type
found in the </span><a style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web">Semantic
web</a><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">.
This representation is independent of the display mode.The same set of
data, extracted from an information system, is shown several ways:</span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<ul style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<li>Interactive mode, fully interactive, designed for
investigating, browsing, drilling into applications internals. It uses <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3</a>, a nice JavaScript
library for manipulating graphs.</li>
<li>The print
mode: the rendered view cannot be modified but is designed to be
printed for reports or presentations. The appearance is very
close to the interactive one, but the layout is always identical, and
the users cannot change it. It
uses <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a>,
an&nbsp;open source graph visualization software. Graphviz is not
an absolute requirement.</li>
<li>The plain HTML mode, convenient to generate reports in
plain text, reports which can be saved, and compared.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">There are also two
output modes, used internally:<br>
</span>
<ul style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<li>A JSON mode of use Javascript-based display. At the moment,
the client-side graphic library is D3, but it might be nice to use also
<a href="http://www.cytoscape.org/">Cytoscape</a>,
another software platform for visualizing complex network. Survol is
extremely modular, and adding a new front-end is a totally independent
task.</li>
<li>A native RDF mode which can be used as an input to such as <strong class="upcase bold-a" style="font-size: 16px;"><a style="font-weight: normal;" href="https://protege.stanford.edu/">Protégé</a><span style="font-weight: normal;">.</span></strong>
<strong class="upcase bold-a" style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;">Protégé
is&nbsp;</strong>an ontology editor and framework, for
building intelligent systems and knowledge-based solutions.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-style: italic; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">ON WHICH PLATFORM ? WHICH PYTHON VERSION ? WHICH REQUIREMENTS ?</span></span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"></span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><img style="float: left; width: 203px; height: 60px;" alt="Python logo" title="Python logo" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Python_logo_and_wordmark.svg/486px-Python_logo_and_wordmark.svg.png"></span><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">Survol
is a
pure-Python software which runs on Windows&#8482; and Linux&#8482; operating
systems. It is easy to port Survol on other platforms: Its modular
architecture is such that, when a module cannot run for any reason, it
is simply disabled.<br><br>Survol
can run on Python 2
or Python 3, in 32 or 64 bits. It does not need special Python
libraries, nor the latest Python version. Some of the most important
Python modules it uses are:<br></span><ul style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><li>socket, sys, os, re: Standard modules which are available everywhere.</li><li><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/psutil">psutil</a>: <span class="st">a cross-platform library for retrieving information on running processes and system utilization</span>. It is not absolutely mandatory but very convenient.</li><li><a href="http://pywbem.github.io/">pywbem</a> if a WBEM server is available.</li><li><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pywin32">pywin32</a>: The fantastic win32 module is really nice to have when running on a Windows machine.</li></ul>
<span style="font-style: italic; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><br></span><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">OTHER REQUIREMENTS ?<br><br></span></span><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">Survol uses <a style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;" href="http://www.graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"> , an </span>open source graph visualization software, to represent its&nbsp; structural information as an SVG diagram<span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">.</span>
It is not absolutely required because Survol has other rendenring
mtehods, but stable SVG representations are convenient to generate
print reports or slides</span>.<br><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><br></span><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHY WMI AND WBEM ? WHAT IS CIM ?</span></span><br><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><br></span><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">To start with, some acronyms. WBEM&#8482; stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web-Based_Enterprise_Management">Web-Based Enterprise Management</a>,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;" class="st">an industry initiative to develop a standard technology for 
accessing management information in an enterprise environment.</span><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"> This standard is governed by DMTF, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Management_Task_Force">Distributed Management Task Force</a>. WMI&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;" class="st">is the Microsoft implementation of WBEM</span><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">. In the Linux world, a common implementation of WBEM is <a href="http://www.openlmi.org/">OpenLMI</a>. It is based on an open-source implementation named <a href="https://collaboration.opengroup.org/pegasus/">OpenPegasus</a>&#8482;. WBEM standard information is delivered with CIM (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Information_Model_%28computing%29">Common Information
Model</a>).&nbsp; The CIM schema is the model for delivering this standard
information.&nbsp; </span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">To
summarize, WBEM define classes of computer-related objects: Processes,
files, network cards etc... have a valid and detailed definition in CIM.</span> Here are some examples:<br><br></span><table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">CIM_Process</td><td style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">This is the base class of a process, which is derived into Win32_Process</td></tr><tr><td style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">CIM_Datafile</td><td style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">A normal file: The concept and its implementation are similar in Windows and Linux. </td></tr><tr><td style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">CIM_Directory</td><td style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">File directories</td></tr><tr><td style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">Win32_UserAccount</td><td style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">A Windows user account. Linux has a specific definition, unrelated to this one.</td></tr></tbody></table><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><br></span><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">SURVOL DATA MODEL.</span></span><br><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><br>The data description offered by WBEM suffers from several drawbacks:<br></span><ul><li><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">It
does not define all the objects we need, because CIM is not really
oriented . For example, database tables, or sockets, or Python packages or Samba&#8482; servers have no definition. It
is indeed possible to add new classes into WIM or WMI, but not in a
portable way, and it requires C++ code compilation etc... this is quite
a heavy process.</span><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"></span></li><li><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">Also:
WQL, the CIM query language, has some limitations: It does not allow
joins between several classes, and a query can return objects of a
single class only. Whereas some information snapshot would require of
all sorts of objects to completely describe a situation: Some examples
which cannot be described by WQL queries could be:All network files accessed by a process, plus their sockets. Or 
linkable symbols from a DLL file. Or SQL queries detected in a process
memory, plus their tables. These are quite common situations when
investigating an application. However, it can be represented with WBEM.</span></li><li style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">On
top of that, WMI and WBEM suffer from several specific performance
problems which are difficult to overcome. These problems come from the
indistinct processing of objects, whatever their behaviour. For
example, selecting all CMI_Datafile objects will return all files on a
given machine: This is obviously very difficult to handle.<br></li></ul><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">Despite
this, building a software on an industrial standard is invaluably
convenient. Therefore, Survol attempts to combine the best of both
worlds:<br></span><ul style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><li>Existing
WBEM classes are always reused. When the classes are different in Linux
and Windows, but a common base class exist, this base &nbsp;class is
chosen. Survol uses only a subset of WBEM ontologies: That is, it uses
only the minimal number of WBEM class properties which are necessary to
uniquely define an object.However, all detected properties are
displayed, when available.</li><li>Survol comes with a lightweight
ontology and data definition where a class is only defined by a
directory in a Python source code tree.</li><li>When an object is
defined by Survol, its equivalent link into WBEM or WMI is calculated
and accessible. WBEM, WMI and Survol use the same moniker strings
(Object path).</li><li>It
is possible to display any WMI or WBEM object and navigate into their
repository. Survol is -also- a complete read-only WBEM objects browser.
Notably, Survol can "talk" with WBEM or WMI running on distant machines.</li></ul><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
</span>
<span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><br></span></span><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">SCANNING PROCESS MEMORY, WHAT DOES IT MEAN ?</span></span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"></span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">In
the memory of a running process (Its heap, or the stack), variables are
created at execution time, and can contain a lot of useful
information which helps understand the process behaviour: File names,
HTTP urls, SQL queries etc... and other resources created on-the-fly,
provide invaluable hints about what a process is doing. Survol comes
with several scripts able to extract this inforation and display the
associated objects. This is not an entirely reliable process, of
course, because these data might be corrupted, or just being created,
or might simply be unused. Still, the implied information is extremely
useful when investigating an application.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">NMAP ?</span></span><br><br><a style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;" href="https://nmap.org/">Nmap</a><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
is a free and open source utility for
network discovery and security auditing. It is able to detect various
resources on a network: Computer, databases, shared disks and other
classes defined in WBEM. Nmap is therefore a convenient investigation
tool in the Survol toolbox. Several Nmap scripts are used, it is very
easy to use more of them.</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"></span><br><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHERE ARE THE SOURCES ?</span></span><br><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">Survol is an
one-source project and as such, its source code is available on <a href="https://sourceforge.net/">Sourceforge</a> and <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>:</span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
